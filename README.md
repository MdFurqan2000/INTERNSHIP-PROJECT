# State Wise Stock Market Sentiment Analysis Using Web Scraping.

## Aim of the Project : 
The project's main aim is state-wise stock market sentiment analysis for social media keywords planning and advertisement.
## Tools and Technologies  used:
This project uses web scraping tools to collect text-based data from platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram. The data is then processed using a natural language processing algorithm for specific keywords, as well as WordCloud for graphical representations of word frequency, which emphasize words that appear more frequently.
## Expected Results:
The result is a list of keywords that can be used for state-wise sentiment analysis of the stock market. By analyzing the keywords output by keyBERT, a user can better plan their social media advertising by understanding what types of keywords they need to use on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and Instagram, as well as the way people from different states view the stock market, and by using WordCloud, the keywords are visualized based on word frequency extracted from the input text file. The word cloud (image) is used to understand the overall sentiment of an individual state towards the stock market in a single image whereas KeyBERT helps in determining the specific keywords that need to be considered before selecting keywords and designing advertisement creatives.
## Framework required to run this jupyter notebook:
• Python 3.6 and above.

• Matplotlib for visualization.

• keyBERT for keywords extraction.

• WordCloud for graphical representation of keywords with high frequency.

• Web scraping codes for blogs and Facebook.
